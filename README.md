Here I analyze product data for an online sports retail company to optimize revenue.
This dataset contains five tables - 

Info- contains product id with its name and description.
Finance -contains product id with its listing price, sale price, discount, and revenue.
Reviews -contains product id with its rating and number of reviews.
Traffic - contains product id and it last visited date on the website.
Brands -contains product id and its brand. 

All Tables have the product id as a primary key

In this project, I utilize various data types, including numeric, string, and timestamp data, focusing on pricing,revenue, ratings, reviews, descriptions, and website traffic. 
Employing functions like aggregation, cleaning, labeling, Common Table Expressions, and correlation, my goal is to provide recommendations for the company to maximize revenue.
